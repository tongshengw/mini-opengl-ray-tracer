# Mini OpenGL ray tracer

This is a C++ OpenGl ray tracer! This project is currently a work in progress.

This project utilises a quaternion based rotation system and uses homogenous coordinate based matrix transformations to manage camera movements. The renderer is created using a screen quad and the fragment shader in OpenGL. Window and keyboard management is done in SDL2.

The following is a demo where spheres are coloured based on their normal vector.
